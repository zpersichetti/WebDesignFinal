			<b> History: </b> The New York Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara the grandfather of current owner John Mara. The Giants won their first Championship in just their 3rd year of playing. They went on
			to win 3 more NFL championships one in 1934, one in 1938, and one in 1956. They then experianced a long period filled with tough losses (including a championship lose in 1958 in the greatest game ever player). The Giants luck 
			began to turn around when they drafted Lawrence Taylor, considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time, in 1981 to play linebacker. They went on to win a Superbowl in 1985 and another in 1990. The Giants experianced
			another draught in the 90's that was ended in 2000 when they returned to the superbowl but were beaten badly by the Ravens. The Giants again experianced a rebirth when they aquired Eli Manning in a draft day trade with the Chargers. Eli has
			lead the Giants to 2 superbowl victories in 2007 and 2011. The superbowl in 2007 is remembered as one of the biggest upsets in sports history as the Giants beat the 18-0 Patriots to end their perfect season.
