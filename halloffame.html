				<p class="center"><em>Selection Process</em>: Inductees are selected by a 46-person comimittee, largely made up of media members, officially known as the Selection Committee.  The Committee consists of one media representative from each pro football city with two from New York, because that city has two teams in the National Football League. There are 16 at-large selectors, all of whom are also active members of the media including one representative of the Pro Football Writers of America, and two members of the Hall of Fame.</p>
				<p class="center"><em>Voting Procedure</em>: To be eligible for the nominating process, a player or coach must have been retired for at least five years. Any other contributor such as a team owner or executive can be voted in at any time. The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail to eventually narrow the list to 25 semifinalists: once in March, once in September, and once in October. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting. Nine members of the Selection Committee also serve as a subcommittee known as the Seniors Committee to screen candidates who finished their careers more than 25 years prior. The Seniors Committee then adds two finalists from that group which makes a final ballot of 17 nominees. To be elected, a finalist must receive at least 80 percent support from the Board, with at least four, but no more than eight, candidates being elected annually.</p>
				<p class="center"><em>Enshrinement Ceremony</em>: The enshrinement ceremony is usually held during the first full weekend in August. An enshrinement festival is held throughout the week in Canton leading up to the enshrinement ceremony.  The day after the enshrinement ceremony is the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game.</p>
